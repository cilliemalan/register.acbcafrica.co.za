                (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
                consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
                and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

                they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.

                comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

                pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
                requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
                have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
